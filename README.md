# FOOndation (JavaScript) #

## Application Architecture (JavaScript) ##

FOOndation is a library to enable the expression of software processes through intents and see them as an event based collaboration of composed pipelines.

The application and its behaviours can be expressed as a simple JSON file focusing more on the intercommunication than not on the implementation.

FOOndation is supposed to help interpreting, validating and facilitating the execution of the application resolving the right modules that satisfy each step of the execution.
